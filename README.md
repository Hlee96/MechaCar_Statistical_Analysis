Vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values in the dataset.
P value 5.35e-11 is smaller than the significance level, meaning that there is a sufficient evidence to reject the null hpothesis.
Linear model has an r-squared value of .7149, meaning that 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model. It does predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

Variance of the coils is 62.29 PSI, within the 100 PSI variance requirement.
Lot 1 and 2 are also within the 100 PSI, variancees of .98 and 7.47. Lot 3 has a variance of 170.29, casuing the variance at the full lot level. 

## t-Tests on Suspension Coils

True mean of the sample is 1498.78, with a p-Value of .06, meaning that there is not enough evidence to support rejecting the null hypothesis.

Lot1: True sample mean of 1500, p-Value of 1, cannot reject the null hypothesis.
Lot2: same outcome of the mean of 1500.02, p-Value of .61, null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
Lot3: has a sample mean of 1496.14, p-Value is .04. Can reject the null hypothesis that this sample mean and population mean are not statistically different.
